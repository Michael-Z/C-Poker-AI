    <h2>
        Usage:
    </h2>

    <p>
        Hand: Input two cards that are in your private hand<br>
        A card is represented by the regex [2-9TJQKA][SDCH]
    </p>

    <h4>
        What's a regex?
    </h4>

    <p>
        A card is represented by a value and a suit.<br>
        Values: 2 through 9, T (10), J (jack), Q (queen), K (king), or A (ace)<br>
        Suits: S (spades), D (diamonds), C (clubs), or H (hearts)<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, a hand may look like "JD TH" for "Jack of Diamonds and Ten of Hearts"<br>
        Note: Don't input the quotes in the text box
    </p>

    <p>
        Community cards are the cards turned up for the Flop, Turn, or River.<br>
        These should be input the same way as hand cards<br>
        Example: "7D 9C QC" for "Seven of Diamonds, Nine of Clubs, and Queen of Clubs"<br>
        Note: Don't input the quotes in the text box
    </p>

    <p>
        For the Opponents text box, input a number specifying how many opponents you will be facing.
